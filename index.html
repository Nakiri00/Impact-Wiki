                <h1 class="Sub">-About Genshin Impact-</h1>
                <p>Genshin Impact is an action role-playing game developed and published by miHoYo. It was released for Android, iOS, PlayStation 4, and Windows in 2020, on PlayStation 5 in 2021, 
                    and is set for release on Nintendo Switch. The game features an anime-style open-world environment and an action-based battle system using elemental magic and character-switching. 
                    The game is free-to-play and is monetized through gacha game mechanics through which players can obtain new characters and weapons. The base game is expanded regularly through patches 
                    using the games as a service model.
                    </p>
                <p>Genshin Impact takes place in the fantasy world of Teyvat, home to seven nations, each of which is tied to a different element and ruled by a different god. 
                    The story follows the Traveler, who has traveled across countless worlds with their twin sibling before becoming separated in Teyvat. 
                    The Traveler travels in search of the lost sibling with their companion Paimon and becomes involved in the affairs of Teyvat's nations.</p>
                <h2 class="region">Mondstadt</h2>
                <p>A city of freedom that lies in the northeast of Teyvat.
                    From amongst mountains and wide-open plains, carefree breezes carry the scent of dandelions — a gift from the Anemo God, Barbatos — across Cider Lake to Mondstadt, which sits on an island in the middle of the lake.</p>
                <h2 class="region">Liyue</h2>
                <p>A bountiful harbor that lies in the east of Teyvat.
                    Mountains stand tall and proud alongside the stone forest, that together with the open plains and lively rivers make up Liyue's bountiful landscape, which shows its unique beauty through each of the four seasons. Just how many gifts from the Geo God lie in wait amongst the rocks of Liyue's mountains?</p>
                <h2 class="region">Inazuma</h2>
                <p>An Isolated Archipelago Far East of Teyvat
                    Overcome endless thunderstorms and set foot on the islands of red maple and cherry blossoms. On winding shores and towering cliffs, and in forests and mountains full of secrets, witness the Eternity pursued by Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho.</p>
                <h2 class="region">Sumeru</h2>
                <p>The city of scholars located in the west-central part of Teyvat.
                    A fantastical nation of both lush rainforest and barren desert, where countless fruits of wisdom grow and are buried. Whether Travelers travel from afar through the forest to reach the academy city or delve deep into the desert to discover the historical ruins of the red desert, a wealth of valuable knowledge awaits them here.</p>
